# Parse Web Demo

This is a demo of a React and Express app that uses Parse as the backend. The app demonstrates the following use cases:

1. User login and registration
2. Adding data to a table
3. Querying a table
4. Persisting a logged in user

This app is a simple message board. You can login or register a new user. Once you're logged in, it displays a list of messages. You can post your own message, which will be added to the page.
